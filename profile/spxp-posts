You can observe this with email addresses for example. Once you started using a mail account, it is almost impossible to switch to a different provider. We started this protocol with full profile portability in mind. This is the reason why this protocol choses the profile key over the profile URI. We are now going to present a mechanism how profiles can seamlessly move from one profile URI to another without disruption."
