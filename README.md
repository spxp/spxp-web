Just clone and open `index.html` in a Browser. It's a static HTML site using [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for structuring and responsiveness.

The `web` subfolder contains a Jekyll version of the web site. Inside the `web` folder, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and visit the site at `http://localhost:4000/`.
