### Building and Development
You need node, npm and gulp. Then:
```
$ npm install
$ gulp dev
```
This will start a local dev server on port 3000 and open the webpage in a browser.

There are a lot more fragments in the original website template than have been used
on this page so far. If you plan to extend this website and you are missing some
design elements or just want to explore what is there, please take a look at the
original demo in the [Krypton](https://github.com/cssninjaStudio/krypton) template
